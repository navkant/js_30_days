            // Let's say we have an array
            const players = ["Wes", "Sarah", "Ryan", "Poppy"];

            // and you want to create a copy, You might think we can just do something like this:
            const team = players;
            console.log(players, team);

            // however what happens when we update that array?

            // now here is the problem!

            // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
            console.log(players, team);

            // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

            // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

            // one way
            // to make a copy of it.
            let team3 = players.slice();

            team3[1] = "hello there";
            console.log(players, team3);

            // or create a new array and concat the old one in
            // create copy using the trick
            let team2 = [].concat(players);
            console.log(players, team2);
            team2[0] = "first player";

            team4[0] = "scott";
            console.log(team4, players);

            // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

            // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

            // with Objects
            const person = {

                age: 80,

            // and think we make a copy:
            const captain = person;
            captain.number = 99;
            console.log(person.number);

            // how do we take a copy instead?

            cap2.number = 60;

            // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
            const cap3 = { ...person };

            // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
